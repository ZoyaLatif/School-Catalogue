# School-Catalogue
School catalogue project from Codecademy: classes, methods and class inheritance
Project Title: School catalogue 

Description: The Department of Education wants the catalog to hold quick reference material for each school in the city.
We need to create classes for primary and high schools. Because these classes share properties and methods, each will inherit from a parent School class. 
Our parent and three child classes have the following properties, getters, setters, and method.
How to use: Download the schoolCatalogue.js file and install Node.js for using this file on your local system. 
Technologies: VS Code Editor and javascript language.
